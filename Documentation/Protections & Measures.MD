## These are internal measures to prevent any bypass or exploit.
If you find an exploit, let me know.

## List
- Permissions to prevent those who are not allowed to cause explosions.
- Mobs and Players are the ONLY sources to cause explosions. BP will not proceed otherwise.
- Shooting projectiles through portals to bypass World Protections does not work.
- Shooting self to cause an explosion does not work.
- Logging projectiles to create one simultaneous explosion does not work.
- Using dispensers to fire any projectile will not create any explosion.
