# List

## 1. Tridents from any entity/player will continue exploding while in water.
- Severity: Major
- Reporter: Owner
- Date: August 23, 2025
- Details: There is no check for stopping tridents from exploding again if theyre not picked up. So when a trident hits a block underwater, the water pushes the trident down and it explodes again when it hits the next block, and so on.
- Your Fix: Avoid having tridents near water if possible or keep it disabled.
- My Fix: In BlockHitCheck, playerShotItem needs to be set to False upon exploding in the Trident section. This prevents an additional explosion.

## 2. If perms are required, mobs cannot harm players/mobs with explosions caused by them.
- Severity: Major
- Reporter: Owner
- Date: August 23, 2025
- Details: When perms are required, mobs such as Skeletons cannot harm others with explosions due to their projectile being counted under the PlayerShot flag.
- Your Fix: If you want mobs to damage players then you would need perms to be disabled.
- My Fix: Create MobShot flag in LaunchCheck and check the mobshot check in BlockHit and EntityHit.

## 3. Arrows get deleted if a player shoots their self despite not having any perms if perms are required.
- Severity: Minor
- Reporter: Owner
- Date: August 23, 2025
- Details: By default, arrows get deleted to prevent exploding yourself. This was an oversight.
- Your Fix: This can be ignored for the most part. Very unlikely to happen or cause issues from players.
- My Fix: Instead of deleting the arrow, just set playerShotItem to False.

## 4. Tridents explode on ground after bouncing off a players head who attempts to shoot their self.
- Severity: Minor
- Reporter: Owner
- Date: August 23, 2025
- Details: Title.
- Your Fix: Can be ignored for the most part, the likelihood of player wanting to hit their self with a trident is near zero.
- Fix: Set playerShotItem to False after the player tries to hit their self.
