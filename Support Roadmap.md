# Support Roadmap
Maintaining API compatibility as far as supported is my primary goal.

Once a new API is required, the previous will have support dropped.
> Ex: 1.16 API is compatible up to 1.21. If 1.22 requires 1.22 API then all 1.16 support is dropped. 

Once support is ended, legacy updates are not prioritized or gauranteed.
